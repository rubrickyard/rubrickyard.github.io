# A Doctor and an Engineer walked into a BrickYard
We are motivated to build meaningful tools utilizing cutting edge AI research with a larger interdisciplinary purpose in mind. We are troubled and inspired by the 1963 letter by Bernard K. Forscher titled [“Chaos in the *Brickyard*”](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/142/3590/339.1) that warns the scientific and tech community against drawing in a sea of disconnected/incoherent facts and tools without understanding their interconnections.
